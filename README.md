# Master-thesis
This repository contain all code used for my master's thesis.

To run the code it is advised to setup an environment for python (i.e. by using `environment.yml` with conda) and install all required packages by invoking `pip install -r requirements`.

Alternativelly, the complete conda environment used for this thesis can be setup via `conda env create -f environment_full.yml`.
